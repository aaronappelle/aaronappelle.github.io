## Research Interests

- World models and video diffusion models  
- Simulating multi-agent motion trajectories in real world environments  
- Convolutional/recurrent architectures for signal processing in challenging noisy settings  
- Generative models for 3D shapes and scenes

## Academic

- Past life as a <span class="tooltip">structural engineer<span class="tooltip-text">subset of civil engineering for designing the structural systems of buildings, bridges, and other built infrastructure to resist gravity and environmental forces like wind and earthquakes</span></span>. Spent all my time trying to automate the calculations and spreadsheets
- Been studying ML/AI since 2019. Most of my work so far has been relevant to built infrastructure, but current interests are much broader
- Interned for 8 months as an AI Resident at [Google X](https://x.company/) working on generative (transformer) models for architectural design grounded in strong physical constraints
- Did a Fulbright research fellowship post-bachelors in Switzerland at EPFL for 1 year

## Personal

- I've run two marathons: the <span class="tooltip">City of Oaks Marathon<span class="tooltip-text">Raleigh, NC</span></span> (2023) and the New York City Marathon (2024)
- I've <span class="tooltip">lived<span class="tooltip-text">≥ 3 months</span></span> on 3 continents and in 8 <span class="tooltip">cities<span class="tooltip-text">municipal, not metropolitan area</span></span>.
- I enjoy learning languages and speak some <span class="tooltip">French<span class="tooltip-text">Je me débrouille bien</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">Spanish<span class="tooltip-text">Aprendido en la escuela</span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">Italian<span class="tooltip-text">"Imparato" dagli amici</span></span> to varying degrees
- Play the sax but not very good at <span class="tooltip">improv<span class="tooltip-text">(yet? unfortunate)</span></span>
